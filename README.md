# Amazing Chest

Tired of building complicated, inflexible item sorters? Do you want an easy way to keep your workshop 
organized so you can focus on other parts of the game?

Amazing Chest is for you! It adds a new 'Sorting Chest' block to your world that will 
automatically pull matching items into itself from any connected hopper chain.

To set up item sorting, just put items in a Sorting Chest that you want to get sorted into it.
Any matching items (and only those items) will be routed to them through the hopper chain. 
It works a lot like a Tango Tek sorting system (but without actually having to build one).


Features

* Super easy item sorting setup 
* Reorganize the sorter at any time by just moving items to different chests
* Sort both stackable and unstackable items
* Sort lots of different items into the same chest
* Works with the Fabric modloader
* Can work without being installed in the client (thanks to the awesome Polymer framework)
