    Tired of building complicated, inflexible item sorters?  Do you want an easy way to keep your
    workshop organized so you can focus on other parts of the game?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Amazing Chest</b> is for you!  It adds a new 'Sorting Chest' block to your world that will
    will automatically pull matching items into itself from any connected hopper chain.
</p>
<p>
    To set up item sorting, just put items in a Sorting Chest that you want to get sorted into it.
    Any matching items (and only those items) will be routed to them through the hopper chain.
    It works a lot like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNV9Mo00Gw">Tango Tek</a> sorting system
    (but without actually having to build one).
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Super easy item sorting setup</li>
    <li>Reorganize the sorter at any time by just moving items to different chests</li>
    <li>Sort both stackable and unstackable items</li>
    <li>Sort lots of different items into the same chest</li>
    <li>Works with the Fabric modloader</li>
    <li>Can work without being installed in the client (thanks to the awesome <a href='https://polymer.pb4.eu'>Polymer
        framework</a>)
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I use a Sorting Chest?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Create a chain of hoppers like shown.
    </li>
    <li>
        Put items in the chests that you want to show up in those chests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure there's a regular 'overflow' chest somewhere on the chain to accept items that
        don't match any of the Sorting Chests.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How does it work exactly?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        When a Sorting Chest is connected to a hopper chain, any items in the chain that match items in the
        Sorting Chest will automatically be routed into it.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Sorting Chest will never allow a hopper to push items into it that don't match an item it already
        contains.
    </li>
    <li>
        Also, if a hopper pulls items out of a Sorting Chest, it will never pull the last item of a given
        type.  This ensures that the Sorting Chest will continue to sort items the items you put into it.
    </li>
    <li>They always keep the last item of a type that is held in the hopper.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lithium Users Read This!</h3>
<p>
    If you also use Lithium, Amazing Chest won't work unless you set <code>mixin.block.hopper=false</code>
    in your <code>lithium.properties</code> file.  This will disable Lithium's hopper-related optimizations
    that are incompatible with Amazing Chest.  (Courtesy of <a href='https://www.curseforge.com/members/valkonmc'>valkonmc</a>)

<h3>How do I set up the mod on my server to work with vanilla clients?</h3>
<p>
    Edit config/amazing-chest.properties and follow the instructions you find there:<br/>
    <code>
        #<br/>
        # Uncomment the 'polymer-enabled' line if you want to run this mod on a server that works with vanilla clients<br/>
        # or clients that don't have the mod installed.<br/>
        #<br/>
        # IMPORTANT: your server must have an appropriate version of polymer installed:<br/>
        #   https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer/versions<br/>
        #<br/>
        # IMPORTANT: setting polymer-enabled will have the following effects for ALL clients connecting to your server:<br/>
        # - Sorting Chests will appear as Trapped Chests (not custom graphics)<br/>
        # - Labels will not be localized (all in English)<br/>
        # - The 'lock button' will not be added to the UI Screen (no protection against messing up your sorting setup)<br/>
        #<br/>
        # polymer-enabled = true<br/>
    </code>
